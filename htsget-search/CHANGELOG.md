- Bump dependencies, fix clippy warnings.
- Avoid reading index unless it is required.
- Remove some unnecessary unwraps.
- Improve errors so that they are more informative.
- Remove RangeBounds on BytesPosition as its use is less readable with classes.
- Fix tests related to response class.
- Remove headers from response if empty.
- Simplify JsonUrl logic.
- Responses should contain a class for all ranges, or no ranges.
- Fix tests.
- Implement RangeBounds for BytesPosition.
- Perform byte position merging when creating data blocks.
- Byte position records class, Header for only header bytes, Body for only body bytes, and None if there is a mix of bytes.
- Allow BytesPosition to record its own class.
- Fix unneseccary storage queries (#107)
- Simplify querying for all records by determining file size.
- Server benchmarks should use non-tls ticket server as this is a fairer comparison to the htsget-refserver.
- Clean up code, format, update dependencies.
- Tests run independently by using dynamic port allocation.
- The GC info field should have a Float type rather than an Integer type.
- Implement non-tls ticket server alongside tls ticket server.
- Rename some traits and structs to clarify their purpose.
- Bump many deps (except querymap) and avoid pulling full tokio in, we just need macros and rt-multi-thread (#96)
- Out of order urls (#95)
- Pinning to noodles-tabix =0.9.0 as suggested in https://github.com/zaeleus/noodles/issues/90#issuecomment-1150361623 as a result of getting CI errors on https://github.com/umccr/htsget-rs/runs/6803593182?check_suite_focus=true#step:6:90
